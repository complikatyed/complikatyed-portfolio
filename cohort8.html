<p>I also assisted in the set up and creation of our class web site.</p>

<p>Our project manager, Erin Page, wanted to get some practice using Gulp.  Since I had used the task runner in my first capstone project, she asked me to incorporate Gulp LiveReload into our group site.  I started my work after Erin completed the initial Gulp setup, and Brennan added Bourbon and Neat, so I was able to practice plugging my own code into an existing project.</p>

<p>Gulp LiveReload proved to be a tricky add, and I probably read more documentation for that one 'assignment' than I had for any other single coding goal thus far.  It was a struggle, but I did finally make it work, and I'm proud of making it happen on my own. </p>

<p>I was also responsible for gathering icons for each of the technology elements we learned in our time at NSS.  We wanted to include links, so the images weren't just static.  After assembling the icon images and their urls, I decided that it would be fun to have them display using an ng-repeat.  That turned out to be a good approach, since it allowed us to rearrange and restructure the layout just by changing the type associated with each icon.</p>

<p>My portion of our technology stack included:  <strong>Gulp-LiveReload (and myriad StackOverflow posts), JavaScript, AngularJS, and Git version control (via GitHub).</strong></p>
