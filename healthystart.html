 <p>For my first NSS capstone, I took on a Code for Nashville hack night idea.</p>

 <p>Alignment Nashville works closely with Metro Nashville Schools, providing a range of resources to assist Metro guidance counselors, school nurses, etc. In March they asked Code for Nashville if brigade members could convert several printed resource guides into mobile apps so that students could access them using smart phones.</p>

 <p>Our more experienced brigade members were already committed to other projects, so I thought my capstone might allow me to help. With Alignment Nashville's approval, I converted their teen pregnancy resource guide from a 28 page PDF into a fully responsive, phone- and tablet-friendly app.  Matia Powell and Jaleesa Johnson at Alignment Nashville are currently working with their in-house tech team to determine the best way to 'officially' deploy "Healthy Start, Healthy Future" in the coming year.</p>

  &nbsp;

  <p>The technology stack for this project included:  <strong>JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, Gulp, Sass, Bootstrap, JSON, Firebase, and Git version control (via GitHub).</strong></p>
