<p>My second capstone is even closer to my heart. As a founding member of Hume-Fogg's academic quiz team, I went on to play quiz bowl at the College of Wooster. In my sophomore year, my team represented Wooster at the regional College Bowl tournament in Flint, Michigan. My husband, Tim, is also a big time nerd -- <em>my team beat his at  Wooster, but he's the one who later got to shine on Jeopardy!</em>  In addition to playing in both high school and college, he has coached quiz bowl teams at both his high school alma mater, and now, at mine.</p>

  <p>Quiz bowl moves quickly, and keeping track of individual player and team stats can be daunting. Figuring out the necessary data relationships seemed like an ideal way to stretch my Ruby on Rails skills, so I'm building a quiz bowl stat tracking app. My daughter (a Hume-Fogg freshman and HFA quiz bowl team member)  enthusiastically volunteered to design my initial wireframes. She's proposed an ambitious set of goals for the project, but I'm confident that I can make them happen.</p>

  <p>The challenge of test- and behavior-driven development has been an exciting addition to this project.  While I was skeptical at first about my ability to approach coding from this angle, I've come to enjoy and appreciate the TDD/BDD philosophy of development.</p>
