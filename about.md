Previously a 7th grade English teacher, Katye sought a career change when she realized that designing and creating technology tools had taken over the bulk of her prep time (and become the most fascinating aspect of her job).  While she misses the excitement of her middle school students, Katye is completely in love with the many-faceted challenges of full-stack coding.

Katye is a proud member of the first four-year graduating class of Hume-Fogg's magnet program.  She earned her bachelor's degree from the College of Wooster, where she majored in Comparative Literature and chose a minor in Women's Studies.  A member of the Russian language house in her sophomore year, Katye spent her junior year studying at the University of Aberdeen, in Aberdeen, Scotland.  Her senior Independent Study project was awarded the James R. Turner prize for Women's Studies, and she was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honor society in 1991.  In 1994 Katye earned her master's degree in English from the University of Virginia.  She subsequently enrolled in Indiana University's Language Education Ph.D. program, where she completed 27 hours, focusing on secondary English certification and research into reluctant readers.


Katye has delivered multiple presentations on integrating technology in the classroom, including a workshop entitled "Paperless Papers: Google Apps in the Middle School Classroom" (with Jake Wilson) at the Biennial Technology Conference for the Tennessee Association of Independent Schools (TAIS).  Her proposal "Flip It, Flip It Well:  Using GAFE for Grammar Instruction" was accepted for presentation at the 2014 conference of the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE).


In addition to being an aspiring developer, Katye is also a reader, knitter, carpenter, seamstress, polymer artist, ever hopeful guitar student, and mom of two teenagers.
